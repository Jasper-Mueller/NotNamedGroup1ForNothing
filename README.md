# NotNamedGroup1ForNothing

We want to focus on something we all thrive for: happiness!

In our group project we are going to examine what drives happines based on the renowned World Happiness Report. The World Happiness Report is a landmark survey of the state of global happiness. It ranks 155 countries by their happiness levels. This survey was released at the United Nations at an event celebrating International Day of Happiness on March 20th.

A list of interesting stories we are looking forward to explore may include (but is not limited to):

1. How did the covid crisis impact the overall level of happiness?
2. How did Brexit affect the happiness of British people?
3. How does happines change in emerging countries which witness rapid economic growth (may with increasing GDP per capita and longer life expectancy)
4. Do geographic factors influence happiness?
5. Do culture characterstics like reedom, generosity, and trust government corruption affect happiness and if they do, to what extend?
7. And many more!

Statistical Techniques Information:
Our project will be EDA focused, so we expect using many visualisations such as correlation plots, box plots,  density plots. To build this we expect to use ggpairs, ggplot2, and RColorBrewer.
