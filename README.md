# NotNamedGroup1ForNothing

We want to focus on something we all thrive for: happiness!

In our group project we are going to examine what drives happines based on the renowned World Happiness Report.

A list of interesting stories we are looking forward to explore may include (but is not limited to):

1. How did the covid crisis impact the overall level of happiness?
2. How did Brexit affect the happiness of British people?
3. How does happines change in emerging countries which witness rapid economic growth (may with increasing GDP per capita and longer life expectancy)
4. Do geographic factors influence happiness?
5. Do culture characterstics like reedom, generosity, and trust government corruption affect happiness and if they do, to what extend?
7. And many more!
